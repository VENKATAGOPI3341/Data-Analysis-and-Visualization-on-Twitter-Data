# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-on-Twitter-Data

This project, "Data Analysis and Visualization on Twitter Data," focuses on transforming raw Twitter data into actionable insights through rigorous data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis using Python, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. By ensuring high-quality data, I was able to develop impactful visualizations that clearly communicated trends and patterns, facilitating data-driven decision-making for stakeholders. The project showcases my technical skills in data manipulation and visualization, and my ability to translate complex data into understandable formats that drive business strategies.
